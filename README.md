## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VideoAudioSummarizationApp.git
    cd VideoAudioSummarizationApp
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser (typically at `http://localhost:8501`).
   
2. Upload a video or audio file in **.mp4**, **.wav**, or **.mp3** format.

3. The app will extract audio (if a video file is uploaded), transcribe it, and display the transcription.

4. View the summarized content in the Summary section.

## Adding Audio/Video Samples to GitHub

To add sample audio or video files to GitHub:

1. Place sample files in a directory within the project, such as `sample_files/`.
2. In your README, provide links to these files for easy access.
3. Use these sample files for demo purposes or to facilitate testing and contributions.
